# Getting started mining with OPCrypto

## Hardware needed
Before you get started, let's make sure you have the necessary hardware to efficiently mine on the blockchain.  There are countless setups, so I won't be covering all cases.  If there's interest, I can add guides for other scenarios.

 - A modern PC with at least one PCIE port (standard graphics cord port)
 - 600 watt or better power supply (some cards will require more)
 - Stable internet connection (wifi is fine so long as it doesn't have frequent disconnects)
 - A modern Nvidia GPU (AMD GPUs will certainly work, but Nvidia currently has an advantage.  A different miner will generally be needed for AMD cards)
 
 ## Software needed
 - ccminer 
  - (64-bit ccminer)[https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/releases/download/2.2.4-tpruvot/ccminer-x64-2.2.4-cuda9.7z]
  - (32-bit ccminer)[https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/releases/download/2.2.4-tpruvot/ccminer-x86-2.2.4-cuda9.7z]
