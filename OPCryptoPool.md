# Getting started mining with OPCrypto

### Goal
At the end of this setup, you'll have a miner with your name and the logo of your choice on our site [http://pool.opcryptos.com](http://pool.opcryptos.com).


### Suggested Hardware
Before you get started, let's make sure you have the necessary hardware to efficiently mine on the blockchain.  While there are countless setups, some are more profitable than others. The suggested hardware is one that has proven to be a profitable configuration, but others most certainly exist. If there's interest, we will add additional configurations and guides for common scenarios.

 - A modern PC with at least one PCIE port - *standard graphics cord port*
 - 400 watt or better power supply - *some cards may require more, please refer to the specifications of the card you intend to mine with*
 - Stable internet connection - *wifi is fine so long as it doesn't have frequent disconnects*
 - A modern Nvidia GPU (GTI 1070 or newer) - *AMD GPUs and CPU Mining will certainly work, but Nvidia currently has an advantage. This setup is specific to NVIDIA hardware.*
 
 ### Software needed
 - Windows 10 - *Other versions of Windows, OSX and Linux will work however, this guide assumes a Windows 10, 64 bit)*
 - [7Zip] (http://www.7-zip.org/)
 - ccminer 
    - [64-bit ccminer](https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/releases/download/2.2.4-tpruvot/ccminer-x64-2.2.4-cuda9.7z)
    - [32-bit ccminer](https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/releases/download/2.2.4-tpruvot/ccminer-x86-2.2.4-cuda9.7z)
  
## I'm ready to mine!  What do I do next?

### Step 1
