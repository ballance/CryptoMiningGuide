# Getting started mining with OPCrypto

### Goal
At the end of this setup, you'll have a miner with your name and the logo of your choice on our site (http://pool.opcryptos.com)[http://pool.opcryptos.com].


### Hardware needed
Before you get started, let's make sure you have the necessary hardware to efficiently mine on the blockchain.  There are countless setups, so I won't be covering all cases.  If there's interest, I can add guides for other scenarios.

 - A modern PC with at least one PCIE port - *standard graphics cord port*
 - 600 watt or better power supply - *some cards will require more*
 - Stable internet connection - *wifi is fine so long as it doesn't have frequent disconnects*
 - A modern Nvidia GPU - *AMD GPUs will certainly work, but Nvidia currently has an advantage.  A different miner will generally be needed for AMD cards*
 
 ### Software needed
 - Windows 10 - *while earlier versions of Windows, OSX and Linux will work, this guide will deal with Windows 10 only)*
 - ccminer 
  - [64-bit ccminer](https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/releases/download/2.2.4-tpruvot/ccminer-x64-2.2.4-cuda9.7z)
  - [32-bit ccminer](https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/releases/download/2.2.4-tpruvot/ccminer-x86-2.2.4-cuda9.7z)
  
## I'm ready to mine!  What do I do next?

### Step 1
 - Update the drivers for your GPU (graphics card).

### Step 2
 - Choose the appropriate version of `ccminer` for your Operating System from the links above
